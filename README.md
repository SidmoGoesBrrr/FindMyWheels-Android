# FindMyWheels Android App

## Overview
The FindMyWheels Android app functions primarily as a camera, integrated within the broader FindMyWheels parking management system. It captures images of cars entering a parking lot when triggered by an Arduino-based device via Bluetooth. The app allows the selection of parking collections by interacting with the backend API, which manages the data and car recognition processes.

## Features
- *Bluetooth Trigger:* Reacts to signals from the Arduino device to initiate image capture of new cars entering the parking lot.
- *Parking Collection Selection:* Enables users to view and select from available parking lots and collections through API requests.
- *Seamless Integration:* Works in tandem with the backend to facilitate image capture and data transmission.

## How We Built It
The app was developed using Java in Android Studio, emphasizing simplicity and effectiveness. It leverages standard Android development tools and practices to ensure reliability and ease of integration with the Arduino module and backend services.
